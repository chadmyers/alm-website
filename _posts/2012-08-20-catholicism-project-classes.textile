St. Mary Cathedral will offer a family catechesis program using the Catholicism DVD series by Fr. Robert Barron:

* The classes will take place on the fourth Sunday of the month after the 3:30pm Mass beginning on September 23rd in the Bishops Hall.
* Childcare will be available for the younger children if there is demand. The current plan is to have a potluck meal in the Bishops Hall before the class.
* The study guides are available for $25.00 each. We plan to place a bulk order through the Cathedral Gift Shop. Please let us know by September 9th if you would like a study guide ordered for you. Payment will be collected once books arrive.
